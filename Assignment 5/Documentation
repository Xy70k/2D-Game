The inspiration for my character was some sort of adventurer. I thought of someone looking for a lost ancient item or trying to save someone from a tower. Games like Legend of Zelda and Kingdom Hearts inspired the design. The tilemap is hills with mountains in the background. I think this symbolizes adventure, and mountains are commonly seen in adventure games. When making my design for the background, I used the brush tool because it seemed to add a more layered effect, which was what I desired. I imported the assets into Unity by going to “Assets”, pressing “Import New Asset”, and finding the files I wanted to import. I changed the layering and sent the character to the front of the canvas. One problem I had was sending the character to the frot, but simply navigating Unity helped me figure out how to do this.
